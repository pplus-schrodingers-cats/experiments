# Theory

## Goal
The goal of this experiment are:
- Obtain the graph $(c_D(v), Re(v))$ to observe ```$((IFD)? "the transition laminar->turbulent" : "the drag crisis")```
- Visualize the flow of a fluid using smoke/vapor

## Formulas

The drag coefficient $c_D$ is obtained by measuring the drag $F_D$ and the velocity of the fluid $v$ using the following relation:
$c_D = \frac{2 F_D}{\rho v^2 A}$, where $\rho$ is the density of the fluid ($\rho _{\text{air}} = 1.225$ kg/m³) and $A$ is the reference area of the immerged object (for a sphere $\pi r^2$).

The Reynolds number $Re$ is can be calculated as follows: $Re = \frac{v L}{\nu}$, where $L$ is the characteristic length of the object (for a sphere $L = r$) and $\nu$ the kinematic viscosity ($\nu _{\text{air}} = 1.5 \times 10^{-5}$ m²/s).

## Measuring v

### using a manometer
Poor accuracy in the pressure scale (10 P)
$v = \sqrt{\frac{2 \Delta p}{\rho}}$

### using a anemometer

should just give v?

## Measuring $F_D$ for a certain v

### using a balance
Measure the weight of the object without any wind $w_i$ and the weight of the object with the wind $w_f$. The difference $\Delta w = w_f - w_i$ should be equal to the drag $F_D$ (am I right?).
One improvement to increase the precision of the weight measurement is to attach the object to a pivot and measure the force through the torque.

### using a load cell
gives the weight through electrical signal (resistence difference due to stress of the wire induced by torque caused by the object hanging).

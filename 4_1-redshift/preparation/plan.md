# Spectra of galaxies

The goal is to capture spectra of some galaxies using the Baader DADOS spectrograph, and if the data is good enough, calculate the [redshift](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redshift) of those galaxies.

A "tutorial" for the spectrograph can be found in [this document](DADOS-Tutorial.pdf). The most important working principles of the spectrograph are described on pages 6-17.

We will be using the telescope(s) in the [observatory in Bülach](https://sternwartebuelach.ch/sternwarte.html), as well as a special lamp (details coming later) to calibrate the spectrograph. There is also a grayscale camera that can be used to capture the spectra and save them to a laptop, which is also available in Bülach.

## Steps

1. Get to Bülach, organise food.
2. Test spectrograph with sun, get some beautiful images of spectra for report cover, get to know the observatory.
3. Wait for darkness, eat etc.
4. Calibrate spectrograph using provided lamp with well-known spectrum. (This should happen as close to observation as possible to get as little effects of temperature fluctuations as possible.)
5. Fix focus and grating angle to not destroy calibration.
6. Capture spectra using provided camera (roughly possible from 22:00). More is always better, but sleeping before sunrise is also kinda cool.
7. Recapture calibration spectrum to provide a second fixpoint in case of temperature shifts.
8. Clean up, go home.

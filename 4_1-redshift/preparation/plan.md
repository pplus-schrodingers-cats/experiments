# Spectra of galaxies

The goal is to capture spectra of some galaxies using the Baader DADOS spectrograph, and if the data is good enough, calculate the [redshift](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redshift) of those galaxies.

A "tutorial" for the spectrograph can be found in [this document](DADOS Tutorial.pdf). The most important working principles of the spectrograph are described on pages 6-17.

We will be using the telescope(s) in the [observatory in Bülach](https://sternwartebuelach.ch/sternwarte.html), as well as a special lamp (details coming later) to calibrate the spectrograph. There is also a grayscale camera that can be used to capture the spectra and save them to a laptop, which is also available in Bülach.

# Theory of the Cloud Chamber
## Supersaturated Vapor
- Due to the warm upper part and the cold bottom we get a temperature gradient. 
- From the top there is a constant supply of alcohol vapor diffusing downward while cooling rapidly.
- Normally the alcohol would then condensate. But in the controlled environment of the cloud chamber (after the setting period) there are no nucleation sites (such as dust or ions). Hence the vapor becomes supersaturated. 
## Ionization of particles
- When we have (for example) a beta-particle it will ionize the particles it interacts with on its way, by stripping them of their electrons.
## Condesnation
- Alcohol is polar, which means the molecule has a slightly positive and a slightly negative part.
- The ionized particles will attract nearby alcohol molecules, which will condesne into small droplets.
- This way there forms a cloud like trace of condesed alcohol along the beta particles track.
## Magnetic Field
- When apllying a magnetic field the charged beta particles will experience the effect of the Lorentz force ${ F_L = e \cdot v \cdot B }$.
- The path of the particle will then curve with a radii of ${ r = \frac{m \cdot v}{e \cdot B} }$

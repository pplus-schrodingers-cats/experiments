# Theory of the Cloud Chamber
## Supersaturated vapor
- Due to the warm upper part and the cold bottom, we get a temperature gradient.
- From the top there is a constant supply of alcohol vapor diffusing downward while cooling rapidly.
- Normally, the alcohol would then condensate. But in the controlled environment of the cloud chamber (after the setting period), there are no nucleation sites (such as dust or ions). Hence, the vapor becomes supersaturated. 
## Ionization of particles
- When, for example, a beta particle enters the chamber, it will ionize the particles it interacts with on its way by stripping them of their electrons.
## Condensation
- Alcohol is polar, which means the molecule has a slightly positive and a slightly negative part.
- The ionized particles will attract nearby alcohol molecules, which will condense into small droplets.
- This way, a cloud-like trace of condensed alcohol forms along the beta particle's track.
## Magnetic field
- When applying a magnetic field, the charged beta particles will experience the effect of the Lorentz force ${ F_L = e \cdot v \cdot B }$.
- The path of the particle will then curve with a radius of ${ r = \frac{m \cdot v}{e \cdot B} }$.

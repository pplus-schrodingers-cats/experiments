# Spectra of galaxies

The goal is to capture spectra of some galaxies using the Baader DADOS spectrograph, and if the data is good enough, calculate the [redshift](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redshift) of those galaxies.

Another idea suggested by some knowledgeable people is to image Jupiter's spectrum, which should produce slanted absorption lines due to red- and blue-shift from rotation.

A "tutorial" for the spectrograph can be found in [this document](DADOS-Tutorial.pdf). The most important working principles of the spectrograph are described on pages 6-17.

We will be using the telescope(s) in the [observatory in Bülach](https://sternwartebuelach.ch/sternwarte.html), as well as a special lamp to calibrate the spectrograph. There is also a grayscale camera and some DSLRs modified for astrophotography that can be used to capture the spectra and save them to a laptop, which is also available in Bülach.

## Steps

1. Get to Bülach, organise food.
2. Test spectrograph with sun, get some beautiful images of spectra for report cover, get to know the observatory.
3. Wait for darkness, eat etc.
4. Calibrate spectrograph using provided lamp with well-known spectrum. (This should happen as close to observation as possible to get as little effects of temperature fluctuations as possible.)
5. Fix focus and grating angle to not destroy calibration.
6. Capture spectra using provided camera (roughly possible from 22:00 until moonrise at roughly 01:45). More is always better, but sleeping before sunrise is also kinda cool.
7. Recapture calibration spectrum to provide a second fixpoint in case of temperature shifts.
8. Clean up, go home.

## Material available at the observatory

- Baader DADOS Spectrograph (probably 1200 lines/mm installed, 900 lines/mm available)
- OSRAM ST111 calibration lamp with glow starter and well-known spectrum
- ZWO ASI 1600MM Pro CMOS camera (black and white, but wide sensitivity)
- Canon EOS 6D and 1100D bodies (modified for astrophotography, i.e. more infrared)
- Laptop with necessary programs installed for capturing and saving images from aforementioned cameras
- All cables we need
- (Lodestar X2 autoguider, which we probably don't need)
